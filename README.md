# React To Do App

This project is a simple and efficient React-based To-Do app that allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks. It leverages local storage to persist tasks even after a page reload.

## Features

- Add Tasks: Users can easily add tasks to their to-do list.
- Delete Tasks: Tasks can be deleted once completed or when no longer needed.
- Local Storage: Tasks persist across page reloads by storing data in the browserâ€™s local storage.

## Technologies Used

**React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  

**React Hooks:** For managing state and side effects (useState).

**Bootstrap:** For responsive and modern styling.

**Local Storage:** To persist task data across page reloads.
